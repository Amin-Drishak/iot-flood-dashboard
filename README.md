# IoT Flood Monitoring Dashboard (Demo)

This project simulates a basic IoT dashboard that ingests water-level sensor data,
detects anomalies, and visualizes the results.

Features:
- Mock API data stream
- Z-score anomaly detection
- Dashboard-style time series plot with flagged events

All data here are illustrative.
