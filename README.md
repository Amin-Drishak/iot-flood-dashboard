# IoT Flood Dashboard (Mock API + Anomaly Detection)

**Author:** Muhammad Amin Khan  
**Purpose:** Simple demonstration of how IoT sensor data can feed into a flood monitoring dashboard.

This prototype:
1. Reads mock water-level data from a simulated API.
2. Flags anomalies using a rolling statistical threshold.
3. Generates an alert plot for visualization.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Flask (for dashboard simulation)
